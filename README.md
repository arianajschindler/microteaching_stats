# microteaching_stats
This is a mini lecture that I created for fellow students in an undergraduate data course from my Senior year at Brown. The focus of the lecture is to introduce students to the statistical packages available for analysis in Python, to learn how to differentiate between different types of data, and how to perform exploratory data analysis to prepare for model selection.
